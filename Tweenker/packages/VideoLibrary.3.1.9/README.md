libvideo (aka VideoLibrary) is a modern .NET library for downloading YouTube videos. It is portable to most platforms and is very lightweight.

## Installation

You can grab a copy of the library [on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VideoLibrary) by running:

    Install-Package VideoLibrary

Alternatively, you can try building the repo if you like your assemblies extra-fresh.

## Supported Platforms

- Xamarin.Android
- Mono (Mac/Linux)

## Getting Started

Here's a small sample to help you get familiar with libvideo:

```csharp
using VideoLibrary;

void SaveVideoToDisk(string link)
{
    var youTube = YouTube.Default; // starting point for YouTube actions
    var video = youTube.GetVideo(link); // gets a Video object with info about the video
    File.WriteAllBytes(@"C:\" + video.FullName, video.GetBytes());
}
```

Or, if you use Visual Basic:

```vbnet
Imports VideoLibrary

Sub SaveVideoToDisk(ByVal link As String)
     Dim video = YouTube.Default.GetVideo(link)
     File.WriteAllBytes("C:\" & video.FullName, video.GetBytes())
End Sub
```
